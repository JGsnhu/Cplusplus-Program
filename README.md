# Cplusplus-Program

This assignment was to create a menu that could validate user input and was also easy to use, it utilized both C++ and Python.
I felt that in each individual language I wrote the code well, improvements I would make is when it comes to integrating the languages together.
To improve this aspect will require further practice and installing and utilizing visual studio to get the further practice that I need.
Being able to jump between languages will be a useful skill when it comes to future work.
To make this program maintainable and adaptable I have included all files needed and included in line commenting to explain the process.
